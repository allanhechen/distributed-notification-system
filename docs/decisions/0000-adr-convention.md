# ADR Convention

## Status

Accepted

## Context

This is the layout for all future ADRs. This is to ensure that all
sections are consistent, and no information is left behind.

## Decision

We will write documents with sections similar to this one, with each
section being mandatory. Lines will not be wider than 75 columns for
legibility.

## Consequences

-   ADRs will be consistent
-   Contributors will need to follow the convention when writing ADRs.
